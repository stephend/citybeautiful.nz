    <h2>Education and Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        BSc in Computer Science from Victoria University of Wellington, 2009.

        <p>
          At this Ruby on Rails / Geospatial startup, I developed our ZoomIn product, but later focussed on consulting work. We were too small for specialization - for most of the time we had 10 or fewer staff. I would meet with customers and analyze their needs, design, implement, test and deploy functionality for our consulting work and products.

Data is available for download or courier delivery, in whole or in part, including processing into different formats or projections. Data can also be published for web use as tiles, including styling, using open standard services, or via an extensive API. I developed a variety of new functionality for the application, both frontend and backend.
