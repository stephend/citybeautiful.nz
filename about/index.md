Hi! I'm Steve. I've worked in software development and GIS, including at [AbleTech](http://www.abletech.co.nz) and [Koordinates](https://about.koordinates.com). I am currently pursuing my 
[Masters in Urban Planning](http://www.creative.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/our-faculty/schools-programmes-and-centres/architecture-and-planning/ap-study-options/ap-murbplan.html) at the University of Auckland.

I'm a member of [Greater Auckland](http://www.greaterauckland.org.nz/), and student member of the [New Zealand Planning Institute](http://www.planning.org.nz/).

You can see my topical and snarky reckons on this [blog](/) or on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nzsd).
Twitter is great. I recommend it.

This blog does not allow public comments (yet). Feel free to send any via email or social media.
