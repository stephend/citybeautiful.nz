Hi! I'm Steve. I work in Wellington, New Zealand, in government, in a vaguely urban field. I have a [Masters degree in Urban Planning](http://www.creative.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/our-faculty/schools-programmes-and-centres/architecture-and-planning/ap-study-options/ap-murbplan.html) from the University of Auckland, and a professional background in software development and GIS.

This blog doesn't have public comments: if you want to comment on a post, do so on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/citybeautiful) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/citybeautiful.nz), or send me an [email](mailto:steve@sd.net.nz).
