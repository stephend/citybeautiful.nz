Like many other websites, this site uses [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics) and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to provide statistical reports on which sorts of people use City Beautiful and which content they view. This information includes which pages on this site you view and for how long, how you got to this site (e.g. by social media, search, or other), and if Google has this information for you, your age, sex, and advertising-related interests. 

This information is presented anonymously, in aggregate, and does not include any personally identifiable information that would allow me or Google to identify any specific person. While this website does not carry targeted advertising, the information Google Analytics collects may also be used to personalise advertising that Google serves you on other websites.

In order to use Google Analytics, this website sets "tracking cookies" on your computer which can be read in future by this site and by Google. It also reads cookies that may have previously been set on your computer by Google, while you were on other websites. To learn more about what cookies are and how they work, see [Cookies and You](https://www.cookiesandyou.com/).

If you wish to opt out of Google Analytics on City Beautiful in particular, you can disable this tracking cookie. See the help menu in your web browser for more information on how to block cookies for a specific website.

If you wish to opt out of Google Analytics across all websites in general, you can also see the current [opt-out options available from Google](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).
